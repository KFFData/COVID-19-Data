# State Social Distancing Actions
<ul>
<li>Beginning July 2021, social distancing actions lessened across all states and we began reporting mask requirements and emergency declarations. Prior to July 2021, information reported here reflects the current status of state social distancing requirements, including stay at home orders, closures of non-essential businesses, limits on large gatherings, school closures, limits on restaurants, and postponement of primary elections.</li>
<li>The data indicate whether the original requirement is still in place or whether it has been rolled back.</li>
<li>Information on state actions is updated daily and compiled from a review of state executive orders, guidance documents, policy bulletins, and news releases.</li>
<li>The "Master File_Social Distancing.csv" file is identical to the most recent date of data, but included to allow for easier download automation.</li>
<li>Data is reviewed and updated regularly. If there are no changes, the most recent data reflects current policy actions.</li>
<li>Please see <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/#socialdistancing">State Data and Policy Actions to Address Coronavirus</a> for state-specific footnotes.</li>
