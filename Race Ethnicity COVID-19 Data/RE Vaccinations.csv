Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Percentages are based on total vaccinations for which race/ethnicity is known. Shares of people vaccinated in each state may not sum to 100% due to rounding, pending, or missing data. Vaccination data may not be directly comparable due to differences in data reported, reporting period, racial/ethnic classifications, and/or rates of unknown race/ethnicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"States vary in whether they report total people who have received at least one vaccine dose, people who have received one dose and people who have received two doses, or total vaccinations administered. Where possible, we report data for the total number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose. However, some states only report total vaccinations, meaning people who have received two doses are included in the data twice. Some states exclude vaccinations administered through the federal long-term care partnership from their data, which affects the demographic profile for people who have received vaccinations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. States vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals in racial categories. Additionally, some states vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals in racial categories in their reporting of vaccination data and in their reporting of cases and deaths. In addition, some states use different racial classifications for their vaccination data and their reporting of cases and deaths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
