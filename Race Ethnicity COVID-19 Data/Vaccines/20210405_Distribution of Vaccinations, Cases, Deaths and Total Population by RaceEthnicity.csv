Sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vaccination data based on KFF analysis of publicly available data on state websites; Cases and deaths based on KFF analysis of The COVID Tracking Project, COVID Racial Data Tracker; total population data used to calculate rates based on KFF analysis of 2019 American Community Survey data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NR: Data not reported because state does not report vaccination data by race/ethnicity or state data has been excluded from vaccination rate analysis since the state reports data based total doses administered rather than people vaccinated. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NA: Data suppressed due to less than 10 observations or insufficient for total population comparison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. States vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals in racial categories. States also vary in their racial/ethnic classifications. For example, some states report Asian and Pacific Islander people separately while others report them as a combined group.Total population data used to calculate rates is matched to each states’ racial classification for vaccination data. Rates may not match those reported on state websites due to differences in the source for total population data. States vary in whether they report total people who have received at least one vaccine dose, people who have received one dose and people who are fully vaccinated, or total vaccinations administered. Where possible, we report data for the total number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose. However, some states only report total vaccinations, meaning people who have received two doses are included in the data twice. Some states exclude vaccinations administered through the federal long-term care partnership from their data, which affects the demographic profile of people who have received vaccinations. Percent of Cases/Deaths Missing Race/Ethnicity Data is the share of total cases/deaths reported in a state for which race/ethnicity is not known. Some states do not update race/ethnicity information as frequently as the count of total cases/deaths for that state, which may increase the % of Cases/Deaths Missing Race/Ethnicity Data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Data for Hispanic people are not reported because the majority of ethnicity data are missing for the state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Data will not reflect people receiving the single dose of the Janssen vaccine because the data reflects people receiving the first dose of two-dose vaccinations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. North Dakota reports vaccination rates by race/ethnicity but does not report vaccine distribution by race/ethnicity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Data does not include Philadelphia County due to differences in reporting data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Individuals may identify as more than one race or ethnicity; totals may not sum to 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. As of 3/29 the state has removed reporting of vaccine data by race/ethnicity. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
