Sources,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vaccination data based on KFF analysis of publicly available data on state websites; total population data used to calculate rates based on KFF analysis of 2019 American Community Survey data.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,
NR: Data not reported because state does not report vaccination data by race/ethnicity or state data has been excluded from vaccination rate analysis since the state reports data based total doses administered rather than people vaccinated. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Percent vaccinated includes people who have received at least one vaccine dose.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. States vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals in racial categories. States also vary in their racial/ethnic classifications. For example, some states report Asian and Pacific Islander people separately while others report them as a combined group.Total population data used to calculate rates is matched to each states’ racial classification approach. Rates may not match those reported on state websites due to differences in the source for total population data.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Data for Hispanic people are not reported because the majority of ethnicity data are missing for the state.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Data will not reflect people receiving the single dose of the Janssen vaccine because the data reflects people receiving the first dose of two-dose vaccinations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. New Mexico is excluded from the total across states due to non-comparable bridged race categories.,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. North Dakota rates based on those reported directly on the state website; the state does not report the number of vaccinations by race/ethnicity. ND is excluded from the total across states because data on number of people vaccinated are not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Data does not include Philadelphia County due to differences in reporting data.,,,,,,,,,,,,
