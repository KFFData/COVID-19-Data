,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NR: Data not reported because state does not report vaccination data by race/ethnicity, state has more than 50% of cases with missing race/ethnicity, or state data has been excluded from vaccination rate analysis since the state reports data based total doses administered rather than people vaccinated. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NA: Data suppressed due to less than 10 observations or insufficient for total population comparison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race but are classified as Hispanic. As of April 19, 2021, data on COVID-19 cases is from CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance Restricted Data. Data prior to April 19 was from The COVID Tracking Project, COVID Racial Data Tracker.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CDC does not take responsibility for the scientific validity or accuracy of methodology, results, statistical analyses, or conclusions presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vaccinations: states vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals in racial categories. States also vary in their racial/ethnic classifications. For example, some states report Asian and Pacific Islander people separately while others report them as a combined group.Total population data used to calculate rates is matched to each states’ racial classification for vaccination data. Rates may not match those reported on state websites due to differences in the source for total population data. States vary in whether they report total people who have received at least one vaccine dose, people who have received one dose and people who are fully vaccinated, or total vaccinations administered. Where possible, we report data for the total number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose. However, some states only report total vaccinations, meaning people who have received two doses are included in the data twice. Some states exclude vaccinations administered through the federal long-term care partnership from their data, which affects the demographic profile of people who have received vaccinations. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Data for Hispanic people are not reported because the majority of ethnicity data are missing for the state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Data will not reflect people receiving the single dose of the Janssen vaccine because the data reflects people receiving the first dose of two-dose vaccinations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. North Dakota reports vaccination rates by race/ethnicity but does not report vaccine distribution by race/ethnicity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Data does not include Philadelphia County due to differences in reporting data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Individuals may identify as more than one race or ethnicity; totals may not sum to 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. As of 4/12/2021, KFF began reporting the sum of partially and fully vaccinated people for Nebraska; previous periods reflected partially vaccinated or first dose administered counts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
